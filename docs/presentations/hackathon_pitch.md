# Nexo+ Hackathon Pitch

## Slide 1: Introduction
**Title:** Nexo+: AI-Powered Cardiac Care Companion
**Tagline:** Bridging the gap between hospital discharge and recovery

## Slide 2: The Problem
- In Chile, 1 in 3 heart failure hospitalizations could be prevented with proper treatment adherence
- 30% of post-heart attack patients abandon key medications within 90 days
- 20% are rehospitalized within 30 days of discharge
- Less than 5% access cardiac rehabilitation
- Cost: Up to $7,800 per patient annually due to preventable complications

## Slide 3: Our Solution
Nexo+ is an AI-powered digital platform that:
- Monitors medication, diet, and exercise adherence remotely
- Detects early warning signs through personalized parameters
- Coordinates care between patients and healthcare teams
- Sends critical alerts via WhatsApp when intervention is needed
- Provides personalized follow-up based on clinical guidelines

## Slide 4: How It Works
1. **Patient Interface:** Easy-to-use web app for recording measurements and symptoms
2. **AI Analysis:** Processes patient data against clinical parameters
3. **Alert System:** Generates color-coded alerts (green, yellow, red)
4. **Intervention:** Automatically notifies healthcare team for critical alerts
5. **Follow-up:** Creates personalized care plans based on patient data

## Slide 5: Technical Innovation
- FastAPI backend with real-time alert generation
- React frontend optimized for both desktop and mobile
