# Nexo+ 3-Minute Hackathon Pitch Script

## Slide 1: Introduction (0:00-0:15)
Good afternoon everyone! I'm [Name] presenting Nexo+, an AI-powered cardiac care companion that bridges the critical gap between hospital discharge and recovery for heart attack patients.

## Slide 2: The Problem (0:15-0:45)
In Chile, one in three heart failure hospitalizations could be prevented with proper treatment adherence. 30% of post-heart attack patients abandon key medications within 90 days, and 20% are rehospitalized within just 30 days of discharge. This is not just a medical crisis but an economic one - costing up to $7,800 per patient annually in preventable complications.

## Slide 3: Our Solution (0:45-1:15)
Nexo+ solves this through an integrated platform that:
- Monitors medication, diet, and exercise adherence remotely
- Uses AI to detect early warning signs through personalized parameters
- Coordinates care between patients and healthcare teams
- Sends AI-generated critical alerts via WhatsApp when intervention is needed
- Provides personalized follow-up based on clinical guidelines

## Slide 4: Technical Innovation (1:15-1:45)
Let me show you how it works. Our platform combines:
- A FastAPI backend with real-time alert generation
- LiteLLM integration for personalized patient communication
- React frontend optimized for both desktop and mobile
- WhatsApp Cloud API integration for critical notifications
- Clinical parameters based on both AHA and Chilean GES guidelines

## Slide 5: Impact & Metrics (1:45-2:15)
Based on our research and initial testing, we project:
- 25% reduction in rehospitalizations
- 80%+ medication adherence (versus current ~50%)
- Increased access to cardiac rehabilitation
- Estimated savings of $7,800 per patient annually
- Improved quality of life and patient outcomes

## Slide 6: Business Model (2:15-2:45)
Our business model is sustainable and scalable:
- B2B subscription model for healthcare institutions
- Per-patient licensing for insurance companies
- Integration with existing hospital systems
- Potential for expansion to other chronic conditions
- Alignment with Chilean healthcare priorities and GES program

## Slide 7: Call to Action (2:45-3:00)
Join us in revolutionizing post-discharge cardiac care. We're ready to pilot Nexo+ in partner hospitals, with a roadmap for nationwide implementation within 18 months. Together, we can save lives, reduce healthcare costs, and transform the patient experience after a heart attack.

Thank you! I'm happy to answer any questions.
