# Lean Canvas: Nexo+

## 1. Problem
- 30% of patients abandon key medications within 90 days after myocardial infarction
- 20% rehospitalization rate in first 30 days post-discharge for heart failure
- 65% of heart failure crises are due to poor therapeutic adherence
- Less than 5% of patients access cardiac rehabilitation in Chile

## 2. Customer Segments
- Primary: Patients discharged after acute myocardial infarction
- Secondary: Cardiologists and healthcare providers
- Tertiary: Healthcare institutions and insurance companies

## 3. Unique Value Proposition
AI-powered digital companion that reduces rehospitalizations by 25% through personalized monitoring and timely interventions for post-myocardial infarction patients.

## 4. Solution
- Remote monitoring of medication, diet, and exercise adherence
- Early detection of warning signs through AI analysis of patient data
- Effective coordination between patients and healthcare teams
- WhatsApp integration for critical notifications
- Personalized follow-up schedules based on clinical guidelines

## 5. Channels

- Premium features for healthcare providers
- Government healthcare program partnerships

## 7. Cost Structure
- Software development and maintenance
- AI model training and optimization
- Clinical validation and regulatory compliance
- Customer support and patient education
- Server infrastructure and security

## 8. Key Metrics
- Reduction in rehospitalization rates
- Improvement in medication adherence percentage
- Number of active patients on platform
- Early interventions triggered by alerts
- Patient satisfaction and quality of life scores

## 9. Unfair Advantage
- Integration of local Chilean healthcare guidelines (GES) with international standards (AHA)
- AI algorithms specifically trained on cardiovascular patient data
- Validated clinical protocols for post-myocardial infarction care
- Focus on a critical 90-day window where intervention has highest impact

## 10. High-Level Concept
Closing the critical care gap between hospital discharge and long-term recovery for heart patients through intelligent monitoring and timely intervention.
