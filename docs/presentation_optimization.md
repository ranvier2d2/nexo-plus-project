## Presentation Strategy

For the 3-minute hackathon pitch, we will focus on:

1. **Problem Statement**: Clearly articulate the critical issue of post-discharge cardiac care gaps
2. **Solution Demo**: Brief demonstration of the key features (Dashboard, Patient Alerts, AI Recommendations)
3. **Technical Innovation**: Highlight the AI integration and WhatsApp notification system
4. **Impact Metrics**: Emphasize the projected 25% reduction in rehospitalizations and cost savings
5. **Call to Action**: Clear next steps for implementation and scaling

The presentation will be visually compelling with minimal text, focusing on the problem-solution fit and the innovative technical approach.
